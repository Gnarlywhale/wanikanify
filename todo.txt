+Get rows to auto populate based on what was saved before.
+After each import, save the list of vocab immediately.
+Make sure clearing cache actually clears the vocab data, but not the metadata.

+Make sure saving and deleting occurs properly.
    + metadata: save when user clicks import.
    + metadata: save when user deletes row.
    + metadata: save when user clicks "save all".
    + vocab: saved when user clicks import.
    + vocab: saved when user deletes row.
+Make sure deleting a row deletes stuff properly.
After they click "import" or "save", the gui controls need to be greyed out to avoid sync issues.
    - Should also be greyed out upon load.
Add in text that tells the user how many entries were imported.
I want the user to be able to specify the columns by number or by the google column identifier (A, B, C, etc.)
    - I want the user to be able to specify whether or not it has a header.
Change everything over to use chrome sync.
    - In each row, I want a status stating how many have been imported.
Add functionality to actually dump the imported vocab into the master dictionary for replacements.
Alert the user if import failed for some reason.

Add in progress download indicator for each entry. Could use JQueryUI lib.
Do validation on all input text boxes.
Play sound when user clicks on a vocab word.
Remove the "allImportedVocabDictionaries" variable. This isn't really needed, since the other page needs to fetch it from chrome cache anyways.
Convert all for loops into jquery loops.
