Fix issue with dialog box text showing up on main page because they're div tags.

Show dialog when sheet is incorrect.
Show dialog when spreadsheet key is incorrect.
Show dialog when to or from column is incorrect.
Change everything over to use chrome sync.
Alert the user if import failed for some reason.
Add in progress download indicator for each entry. Could use JQueryUI lib.
