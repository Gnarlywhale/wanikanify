Get rows to auto populate based on what was saved before.
Remove the "allImportedVocabDictionaries" variable. This isn't really needed, since the other page needs to fetch it from chrome cache anyways.
Make sure saving and deleting occurs properly.
Make sure deleting a row deletes stuff properly.
Add in progress download indicator for each entry. Could use JQueryUI lib.
Add in text that tells the user how many entries were imported.
I want the user to be able to specify whether or not it has a header.
After each import, save the list of vocab immediately.
I want the user to be able to specify the columns by number or by the google column identifier (A, B, C, etc.)
If they already imported some data, the import button should change to "reimport?"
    - If they delete the cache, the button should change back to "import", based on whether or not zero elements have been imported.
Change everything over to use chrome sync.
    - In each row, I want a status stating how many have been imported.
Figure out what to do when a user changes a text field.
    - Probably do nothing, and only when they click "import" do we save the metadata.
Convert all for loops into jquery loops.
Do validation on all input text boxes.?
Add in functionality to play the sound when user clicks on it.
