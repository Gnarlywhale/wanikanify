## About

Wanikanify is a Google Chrome Extension for studying Japanese.

Wanikanify takes the vocabulary you've studied on Wanikani, finds the english word on a webpage and substitues the kanji character. As you learn more kanji, your webpages begin to fill up with kanji! Wanikanify can find words anywhere on a webpage and replace it for kanji characters. It is a great utility for practicing and recalling vocabulary you may have forgotten. 

To get started, install the extension, and go to the options page. Add your public WaniKani API key, which can be found on on the WaniKani website, and hit save.

Navigate to your favorite webpages, hit the Crabigator and read as normal. As you read you'll come across kanji characters you should know. Do you remember what the mean? How to pronounce them?
